        The messages are returned in reverse chronological order.

        .. include:: /_includes/usable-by/users.rst

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.
                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

            limit (``int``, *optional*):
                Limits the number of messages to be retrieved.
                By default, no limit is applied and all messages are returned.

            offset (``int``, *optional*):
                Sequential number of the first message to be returned.
                Negative values are also accepted and become useful in case you set offset_id or offset_date.

            offset_id (``int``, *optional*):
                Identifier of the first message to be returned.
                This parameter is deprecated and should not be used.
                Use `min_id` / `max_id` instead for proper filtering.

            offset_date (:py:obj:`~datetime.datetime`, *optional*):
                Pass a date as offset to retrieve only older messages starting from that date.

            min_id (``int``, *optional*):
                If a positive value was provided, the method will return only messages
                with IDs more than or equal to min_id (inclusive).

            max_id (``int``, *optional*):
                If a positive value was provided, the method will return only messages
                with IDs less than or equal to max_id (inclusive).

            reverse (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass True to retrieve the messages from oldest to newest.

        Returns:
            ``Generator``: A generator yielding :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Message` objects.
