        """Use this method to stream a partial message to a user while the message is being generated.

        .. note::

            The streamed draft is ephemeral and acts as a temporary 30-second preview - once the output is finalized,
            you must call :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.send_message` with the complete message to persist it in the user's chat.

        .. include:: /_includes/usable-by/bots.rst

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.

            draft_id (``int``):
                Unique identifier of the message draft, must be non-zero.
                Changes of drafts with the same identifier are animated.

            text (``str``, *optional*):
                Text of the message to be sent, 0-4096 characters after entities parsing.
                Pass an empty text to show a "Thinking…" placeholder.

            message_thread_id (``int``, *optional*):
                Unique identifier for the target message thread.

            parse_mode (:obj:`~pyrogram.enums.ParseMode`, *optional*):
                By default, texts are parsed using both Markdown and HTML styles.
                You can combine both syntaxes together.

            entities (List of :obj:`~pyrogram.types.MessageEntity`, *optional*):
                List of special entities that appear in message text, which can be specified instead of *parse_mode*.

            can_stop (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass *True* to show the user a button to stop further drafts.

            keep_on_stop (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass *True* to keep the draft in the chat when the button is pressed.
                The draft will still disappear after a short time or if the bot sends a message.
                To fully preserve the partial draft, the bot should send it as a new message.

        Returns:
            ``bool``: On success, True is returned.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python


                text = "Hello! I'm your Pyrogram bot! How can I help you?"
                words = text.split()
                draft_id = app.rnd_id()

                # Send thinking placeholder
                await app.send_message_draft(chat_id, draft_id)

                await asyncio.sleep(5)

                for i, word in enumerate(words):
                    await app.send_message_draft(
                        chat_id=chat_id,
