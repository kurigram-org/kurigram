        The messages are returned in reverse chronological order.

        Parameters:
            user_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.
                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

            limit (``int``, *optional*):
                Limits the number of messages to be retrieved.
                By default, no limit is applied and all messages are returned.

            min_id (``int``, *optional*):
                If a positive value was provided, the method will return only messages
                with IDs more than or equal to min_id (inclusive).

                If a positive value was provided, the method will return only messages
