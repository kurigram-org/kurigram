        .. include:: /_includes/usable-by/users-bots.rst

        .. note::

            - **For BOTS Only**: A message can only be deleted if it was sent less than 48 hours ago.
            - Service messages about a supergroup, channel, or forum topic creation can't be deleted.
            - A dice message in a private chat can only be deleted if it was sent more than 24 hours ago.
            - :obj:`~pyrogram.Client` can delete outgoing messages in private chats, groups, and supergroups.
            - :obj:`~pyrogram.Client` can delete incoming messages in private chats.
            - :obj:`~pyrogram.Client` granted can_post_messages permissions can delete outgoing messages in channels.
            - If the :obj:`~pyrogram.Client` is an administrator of a group, it can delete any message there.
            - If the :obj:`~pyrogram.Client` has can_delete_messages permission in a supergroup or a channel, it can delete any message there.

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.
                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

            message_ids (``int`` | Iterable of ``int``):
                An iterable of message identifiers to delete (integers) or a single message id.

            revoke (``bool``, *optional*):
                Deletes messages on both parts.
                This is only for private cloud chats and normal groups, messages on
                channels and supergroups are always revoked (i.e.: deleted for everyone).
                Defaults to True.

            is_scheduled (``bool``, *optional*):
                If True, the message will be deleted from the scheduled messages.
                For userbots only.

        Returns:
            ``int``: Amount of affected messages
