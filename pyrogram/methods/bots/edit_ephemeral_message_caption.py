        Note that it is not guaranteed that the user will receive the message edit event, especially if they are offline.

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.

            receiver_user_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the user who received the message.

            ephemeral_message_id (``int``):
                Identifier of the ephemeral message to edit.

            caption (``str``, *optional*):
                New caption of the message, 0-1024 characters after entities parsing.

            parse_mode (:obj:`~pyrogram.enums.ParseMode`, *optional*):
                By default, texts are parsed using both Markdown and HTML styles.
                You can combine both syntaxes together.

            caption_entities (List of :obj:`~pyrogram.types.MessageEntity`, *optional*):
                List of special entities that appear in the caption, which can be specified instead of *parse_mode*.

            show_caption_above_media (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass *True* if the caption must be shown above the message media.
                Supported only for animation, photo and video messages.

            reply_markup (:obj:`~pyrogram.types.InlineKeyboardMarkup`, *optional*):
                An InlineKeyboardMarkup object.

        Returns:
            :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Message` | ``None``: On success, the edited message is returned, otherwise, in case
            the server answered with no message, None is returned.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                await app.edit_ephemeral_message_caption(chat_id, message_id, receiver_user_id, "new media caption")
