        .. include:: /_includes/usable-by/bots.rst

        Parameters:
            title (``str``):
                Product name, 1-32 characters.

            description (``str``):
                Product description, 1-255 characters

            payload (``str`` | ``bytes``):
                Bot-defined invoice payload, 1-128 bytes. This will not be displayed to the user, use for your internal processes.

            currency (``str``):
                Three-letter ISO 4217 currency code, see `more on currencies <https://core.telegram.org/bots/payments#supported-currencies>`_. Pass ``XTR`` for payments in `Telegram Stars <https://t.me/BotNews/90>`_.

            prices (List of :obj:`~pyrogram.types.LabeledPrice`):
                Price breakdown, a JSON-serialized list of components (e.g. product price, tax, discount, delivery cost, delivery tax, bonus, etc.). Must contain exactly one item for payments in `Telegram Stars <https://t.me/BotNews/90>`_.

            provider_token (``str``, *optional*):
                Payment provider token, obtained via `@BotFather <https://t.me/botfather>`_. Pass an empty string for payments in `Telegram Stars <https://t.me/BotNews/90>`_.

            subscription_period (``int``, *optional*):
                The number of seconds the subscription will be active for before the next payment.
                The currency must be set to “XTR” (Telegram Stars) if the parameter is used.
                Currently, it must always be 2592000 (30 days) if specified.

            max_tip_amount (``int``, *optional*):
                The maximum accepted amount for tips in the smallest units of the currency (integer, **not** float/double). For example, for a maximum tip of ``US$ 1.45`` pass ``max_tip_amount = 145``. See the exp parameter in `currencies.json <https://core.telegram.org/bots/payments/currencies.json>`_, it shows the number of digits past the decimal point for each currency (2 for the majority of currencies). Defaults to 0. Not supported for payments in `Telegram Stars <https://t.me/BotNews/90>`_.

            suggested_tip_amounts (List of ``int``, *optional*):
                An array of suggested amounts of tips in the smallest units of the currency (integer, **not** float/double). At most 4 suggested tip amounts can be specified. The suggested tip amounts must be positive, passed in a strictly increased order and must not exceed ``max_tip_amount``.

            start_parameter (``str``, *optional*):
                Unique deep-linking parameter. If left empty, **forwarded copies** of the sent message will have a Pay button, allowing multiple users to pay directly from the forwarded message, using the same invoice. If non-empty, forwarded copies of the sent message will have a URL button with a deep link to the bot (instead of a Pay button), with the value used as the start parameter.

            provider_data (``str``, *optional*):
                JSON-serialized data about the invoice, which will be shared with the payment provider. A detailed description of required fields should be provided by the payment provider.

            photo_url (``str``, *optional*):
                URL of the product photo for the invoice. Can be a photo of the goods or a marketing image for a service. People like it better when they see what they are paying for.

            photo_size (``int``, *optional*):
                Photo size in bytes

            photo_width (``int``, *optional*):
                Photo width

            need_phone_number (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass True if you require the user's phone number to complete the order. Ignored for payments in `Telegram Stars <https://t.me/BotNews/90>`_.

            need_email (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass True if you require the user's email address to complete the order. Ignored for payments in `Telegram Stars <https://t.me/BotNews/90>`_.

                Pass True if you require the user's shipping address to complete the order. Ignored for payments in `Telegram Stars <https://t.me/BotNews/90>`_.

            send_phone_number_to_provider (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass True if the user's phone number should be sent to the provider. Ignored for payments in `Telegram Stars <https://t.me/BotNews/90>`_.

            send_email_to_provider (``bool``, *optional*):
