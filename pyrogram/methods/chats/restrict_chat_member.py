        Pass True for all permissions to lift restrictions from a user.

        .. include:: /_includes/usable-by/users-bots.rst

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.

            user_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target user.
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

            permissions (:obj:`~pyrogram.types.ChatPermissions`):
                New user permissions.

            until_date (:py:obj:`~datetime.datetime`, *optional*):
                Date when the user will be unbanned.
                If user is banned for more than 366 days or less than 30 seconds from the current time they are
                considered to be banned forever. Defaults to epoch (ban forever).

        Returns:
            :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Chat`: On success, a chat object is returned.
