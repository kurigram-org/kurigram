        Parameters:

            message_auto_delete_time (``int``, *optional*):
                Message auto-delete time value, in seconds, must be from 0 up to 365 * 86400 and be divisible by 86400.
                If None, then messages aren't deleted automatically.

            for_import (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass True to create a supergroup for importing messages.

        Returns:
