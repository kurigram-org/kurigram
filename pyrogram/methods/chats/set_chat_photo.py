        """Set a new chat photo or video (H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video, max 5 seconds).

        The ``photo`` and ``video`` arguments are mutually exclusive.
        Pass either one as named argument (see examples below).

        You must be an administrator in the chat for this to work and must have the appropriate admin rights.

        .. include:: /_includes/usable-by/users-bots.rst

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.

            photo (``str`` | ``os.PathLike`` | ``BinaryIO``, *optional*):
                New chat photo. You can pass a :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Photo` file_id, a file path to upload a new photo
                from your local machine or a binary file-like object with its attribute
                ".name" set for in-memory uploads.

            video (``str`` | ``os.PathLike`` | ``BinaryIO``, *optional*):
                New chat video. You can pass a :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Video` file_id, a file path to upload a new video
                from your local machine or a binary file-like object with its attribute
                ".name" set for in-memory uploads.

            video_start_ts (``float``, *optional*):
                The timestamp in seconds of the video frame to use as photo profile preview.

        Returns:
            :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Message` | ``None``: On success, the sent service message is returned,
            otherwise, in case the server answered with no message, None is returned.

        Raises:
            ValueError: if a chat_id belongs to user.
            FileNotFoundError: In case a local ``os.PathLike`` doesn't point to an existing file.
