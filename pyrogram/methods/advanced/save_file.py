        """Upload a file onto Telegram servers, without actually sending the message to anyone.
        Useful whenever an InputFile type is required.

        .. note::

            This is a utility method intended to be used **only** when working with raw
            :obj:`functions <pyrogram.raw.functions>` (i.e: a Telegram API method you wish to use which is not
            available yet in the Client class as an easy-to-use method).

        .. include:: /_includes/usable-by/users-bots.rst

        Parameters:
            path (``str`` | ``os.PathLike`` | ``BinaryIO``):
                The path of the file you want to upload that exists on your local machine or a binary file-like object
                with its attribute ".name" set for in-memory uploads.

            file_id (``int``, *optional*):
                In case a file part expired, pass the file_id and the file_part to retry uploading that specific chunk.

            file_part (``int``, *optional*):
                In case a file part expired, pass the file_id and the file_part to retry uploading that specific chunk.

            progress (``Callable``, *optional*):
                Pass a callback function to view the file transmission progress.
                The function must take *(current, total)* as positional arguments (look at Other Parameters below for a
                detailed description) and will be called back each time a new file chunk has been successfully
                transmitted.

            progress_args (``tuple``, *optional*):
                Extra custom arguments for the progress callback function.
                You can pass anything you need to be available in the progress callback scope; for example, a Message
                object or a Client instance in order to edit the message with the updated progress status.

        Other Parameters:
            current (``int``):
                The amount of bytes transmitted so far.

            total (``int``):
                The total size of the file.

            *args (``tuple``, *optional*):
                Extra custom arguments as defined in the ``progress_args`` parameter.
                You can either keep ``*args`` or add every single extra argument in your function signature.

        Returns:
            ``InputFile`` | ``None``: On success, the uploaded file is returned in form of an InputFile object. In case
            *path* is None, and in case *file_id* is given so that a single missing part is uploaded instead of the
            whole file, None is returned. A failed upload raises.

        Raises:
            RPCError: In case of a Telegram RPC error, including one that happened while a part was being sent.
