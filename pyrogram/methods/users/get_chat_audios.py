        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.
                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

            limit (``int``, *optional*):
                Limits the number of profile photos to be retrieved.
                By default, no limit is applied and all profile photos are returned.

        Returns:
            ``Generator``: A generator yielding :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Audio` objects.
