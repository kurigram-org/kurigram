class GetUsers:
    # `str` is itself an iterable of `str`, so a username matches both overloads.
    #  The single-user one comes first, resolving it the way the body does.

        """Get information about a user.
        You can retrieve up to 200 users at once.

        .. include:: /_includes/usable-by/users-bots.rst

        Parameters:
            user_ids (``int`` | ``str`` | Iterable of ``int`` or ``str``):
                A list of User identifiers (id or username) or a single user id/username.
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

        Returns:
            :obj:`~pyrogram.types.User` | List of :obj:`~pyrogram.types.User` | ``None``: In case *user_ids* was not a
            list, a single user is returned, otherwise a list of users is returned. Telegram answers with nothing
            for an identifier that belongs to no user (a channel, a chat, a deleted account, or a peer this
            account cannot see), in which case ``None`` is returned for a single identifier and the list simply
            leaves that identifier out. Use :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.get_user` to be told which one is missing.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                # Get information about one user
                await app.get_users("me")

                # Get information about multiple users at once
                await app.get_users([user_id1, user_id2, user_id3])
        """

        is_iterable = not isinstance(user_ids, (int, str))
        user_ids = list(user_ids) if is_iterable else [user_ids]
        user_ids = await asyncio.gather(*[self.resolve_peer(i) for i in user_ids])

        r = await self.invoke(raw.functions.users.GetUsers(id=user_ids))

        users = types.List()

        for i in r:
            user = await types.User._parse(self, i)

            # `User._parse()` gives `None` back for a `userEmpty`, which is what an identifier that
            #  belongs to no user comes back as. A list holding it holds a hole nobody can iterate
            #  past, and the identifiers Telegram omits entirely are already absent from it.
            if user is not None:
                users.append(user)

        return users if is_iterable else users[0] if users else None
