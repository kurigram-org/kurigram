        """Start the client, idle the main script and finally stop the client.

        When calling this method without any argument it acts as a convenience method that calls
        :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.start`, :meth:`~pyrogram.idle` and :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.stop` in sequence.
        It makes running a single client less verbose.

        If you want to run multiple clients at once, see :meth:`pyrogram.compose`.

        Parameters:
            use_qr (``bool``, *optional*):
                Use QR code authorization instead of the interactive prompt.
                For new authorizations only.
                Defaults to False.

            except_ids (List of ``int``, *optional*):
                List of already logged-in user IDs, to prevent logging in twice with the same user.

        Raises:
            ConnectionError: In case you try to run an already started client.
            ImportError: In case ``use_qr`` is True and the ``qrcode`` extra is not installed.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                from pyrogram import Client

                app = Client("my_account")
