        """Start the client.

        This method connects the client to Telegram and, in case of new sessions, automatically manages the
        authorization process using an interactive prompt.

        .. note::

            QR code authorization needs the ``qrcode`` extra: ``pip install "kurigram[qrcode]"``.

        Parameters:
            use_qr (``bool``, *optional*):
                Use QR code authorization instead of the interactive prompt.
                For new authorizations only.
                Defaults to False.

            except_ids (List of ``int``, *optional*):
                List of already logged-in user IDs, to prevent logging in twice with the same user.

        Returns:
            :obj:`~pyrogram.Client`: The started client itself.

        Raises:
            ConnectionError: In case you try to start an already started client.
            ImportError: In case ``use_qr`` is True and the ``qrcode`` extra is not installed.
