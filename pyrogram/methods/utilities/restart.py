        """Restart the Client.

        This method will first call :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.stop` and then :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.start` in a row in
        order to restart a client using a single method.

        Parameters:
            block (``bool``, *optional*):
                Blocks the code execution until the client has been restarted. It is useful with ``block=False`` in case
                you want to restart the own client within an handler in order not to cause a deadlock.
                Defaults to True.

            clear_handlers (``bool``, *optional*):
                Clear the already existing handlers on restart the client.
                Default to False.

        Returns:
            :obj:`~pyrogram.Client`: The restarted client itself.

        Raises:
            ConnectionError: In case you try to restart a stopped Client.
