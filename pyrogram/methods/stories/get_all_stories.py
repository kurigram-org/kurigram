        Parameters
            next (``bool``, *optional*):
                If next and state are both set, uses the passed state to paginate to the next results.
                If neither state nor next are set, fetches the initial page.
                If state is set and next is not set, check for changes in the active/hidden peerset.

            hidden (``bool``, *optional*):
                If set, fetches the hidden active story list, otherwise fetches the active story list.

            state (``str``, *optional*):
                If next and state are both set, uses the passed state to paginate to the next results.
                If neither state nor next are set, fetches the initial page.
                If state is set and next is not set, check for changes in the active/hidden peerset.

        Returns:
            ``Generator``: On success, a generator yielding :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Story` objects is returned.

                async for story in app.get_all_stories():
