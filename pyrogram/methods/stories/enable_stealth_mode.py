        Parameters:
            past (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass True to erase views from any stories opened in the past stories_stealth_past_period seconds, as specified by the client configuration.

        Returns:
            :obj:`~pyrogram.types.StoriesStealthMode`: On success, the information about stealth mode session is returned.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                # Erase views from any stories opened in the past stories_stealth_past_period seconds
