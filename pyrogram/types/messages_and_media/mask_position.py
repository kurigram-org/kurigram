class MaskPosition(Object):
    """This object describes the position on faces where a mask should be placed by default.

    Parameters:
        point (:obj:`~pyrogram.enums.MaskPointType`):
            The part of the face relative to which the mask should be placed.

        x_shift (``float``):
            Shift by X-axis measured in widths of the mask scaled to the face size, from left to right.
            For example, choosing -1.0 will place mask just to the left of the default mask position.

        y_shift (``float``):
            Shift by Y-axis measured in heights of the mask scaled to the face size, from top to bottom.
            For example, 1.0 will place the mask just below the default mask position.

        scale (``float``):
            Mask scaling coefficient. For example, 2.0 means double size.
