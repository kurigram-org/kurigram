class ChosenInlineResult(Object, Update):
    """A :doc:`result <InlineQueryResult>` of an inline query chosen by the user and sent to their chat partner.

    .. note::

        In order to receive these updates, your bot must have "inline feedback" enabled. You can enable this feature
        with `@BotFather <https://t.me/botfather>`_.

    Parameters:
        result_id (``str``):
            The unique identifier for the result that was chosen.

        from_user (:obj:`~pyrogram.types.User`):
            The user that chose the result.

        query (``str``):
            The query that was used to obtain the result.

        location (:obj:`~pyrogram.types.Location`, *optional*):
            Sender location, only for bots that require user location.

        inline_message_id (``str``, *optional*):
            Identifier of the sent inline message.
            Available only if there is an :doc:`inline keyboard <InlineKeyboardMarkup>` attached to the message.
            Will be also received in :doc:`callback queries <CallbackQuery>` and can be used to edit the message.

        matches (List of regex Matches, *optional*):
            A list containing all `Match Objects <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#match-objects>`_ that match
            the query of this chosen query. Only applicable when using :obj:`filters.regex <pyrogram.filters.regex>`.
