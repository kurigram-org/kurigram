    Parameters:
        id (``str``):
            Unique identifier for this query.

        from_user (:obj:`~pyrogram.types.User`):
            User who sent the query.

        currency (``str``):
            Three-letter ISO 4217 `currency <https://core.telegram.org/bots/payments#supported-currencies>`_ code, or ``XTR`` for payments in `Telegram Stars <https://t.me/BotNews/90>`_.

        total_amount (``int``):
            Total price in the smallest units of the currency (integer, **not** float/double). For example, for a price of ``US$ 1.45`` pass ``amount = 145``. See the __exp__ parameter in `currencies.json <https://core.telegram.org/bots/payments/currencies.json>`_, it shows the number of digits past the decimal point for each currency (2 for the majority of currencies).

        invoice_payload (``str``):
            Bot-defined invoice payload, 1-128 bytes. This will not be displayed to the user, use for your internal processes.

            Identifier of the shipping option chosen by the user.

        order_info (:obj:`~pyrogram.types.OrderInfo`, *optional*):
