class ChatBoostHandler(Handler[ChatBoostCallbackType]):
    """The ChatBoost handler class. Used to handle applied chat boosts.
    It is intended to be used with :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.add_handler`

    For a nicer way to register this handler, have a look at the
    :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.on_chat_boost` decorator.

    Parameters:
        callback (``Callable``):
            Pass a function that will be called when a new boost applied. It takes *(client, boost)*
            as positional arguments (look at the section below for a detailed description).

        filters (:obj:`~pyrogram.filters.Filter`):
            Pass one or more filters to allow only a subset of updates to be passed
            in your callback function.

    Other parameters:
        client (:obj:`~pyrogram.Client`):
            The Client itself, useful when you want to call other API methods inside the handler.

        boost (:obj:`~pyrogram.types.ChatBoostUpdated`):
            The applied chat boost.
