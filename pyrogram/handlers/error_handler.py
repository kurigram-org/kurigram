class ErrorHandler(Handler[ErrorCallbackType]):
    """The Error handler class. Used to handle unexpected errors.

    It is intended to be used with :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.add_handler`.

    For a more convenient way to register this handler, see the
    :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.on_error` decorator.

    Parameters:
        callback (``Callable``):
            A function that will be called whenever an unexpected error is raised.
            It takes *(client, exception, handler, update, users, chats)* as positional arguments
            (look at the section below for a detailed description).

        exceptions (``Exception`` | List of ``Exception``, *optional*):
            An exception type or a sequence of exception types that this handler should handle.
            If None, the handler will catch any exception that is a subclass of ``Exception``.

        filters (:obj:`~pyrogram.filters.Filter`, *optional*):
            Pass one or more filters to allow only a subset of updates to be passed
            in your callback function.

    Other parameters passed to the callback:
        client (:obj:`~pyrogram.Client`):
            The Client instance, useful when calling other API methods inside the error handler.

        exception (``Exception``):
            The Exception instance that was raised.

        handler (:obj:`~pyrogram.handlers.handler.Handler`):
            The Handler instance from which the exception was raised.

        update (:obj:`~pyrogram.raw.base.Update`):
            The received update, which can be one of the many single Updates listed in the
            :obj:`~pyrogram.raw.base.Update` base type.

        users (``dict``):
            Dictionary of all :obj:`~pyrogram.raw.base.User` mentioned in the update.
            You can access extra info about the user (such as *first_name*, *last_name*, etc...) by using
            the IDs you find in the *update* argument (e.g.: *users[1768841572]*).

        chats (``dict``):
            Dictionary of all :obj:`~pyrogram.raw.base.Chat` mentioned in the update.
            You can access extra info about the chat (such as *title*, *participants_count*, etc...)
            by using the IDs you find in the *update* argument (e.g.: *chats[1701277281]*).
