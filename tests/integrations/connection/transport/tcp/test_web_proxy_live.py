"""End-to-end smoke test for the WEB proxy scheme against a real,
already-deployed relay + stock MTProxy + real Telegram DC.

This is deliberately NOT a mock: it drives the full chain - the obfuscated2
handshake TCP._connect_via_web_proxy performs, the long-poll carrier, the
hosted relay, a real stock MTProxy instance, and a real Telegram datacenter -
three ways:

1. A hand-built plaintext ``req_pq_multi`` query (MTProto's first,
   unencrypted handshake step, which needs no auth key), checking a genuine
   ``resPQ`` comes back with the nonce we sent. Deliberately low-level so a
   reviewer can see exactly which bytes cross the wire without needing to
   trust anything else in this codebase.
2. A full, real Diffie-Hellman key exchange via kurigram's own
   ``pyrogram.session.auth.Auth``, proving a *sustained*, multi-message,
   partially-encrypted exchange works end to end through the same transport -
   not just one request/response.
3. An ordinary high-level API call on an existing, already-authorized session,
   which is the only one of the three that exercises a fully encrypted MTProto
   session with its own salt, acknowledgements and update loop on top.

All three run the stock transports unmodified - proxy={"scheme": "web", ...} is
all that changes, and the secret picks the framing; see tcp.py's
TCP._connect_via_web_proxy.

Skipped unless the environment carries a relay to run against, which nobody
but its operator has. Fill in .env.test from .env.test.example, then::
