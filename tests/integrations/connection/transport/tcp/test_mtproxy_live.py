"""End-to-end smoke test for the classic MTProxy scheme against a real,
already-deployed proxy and a real Telegram datacenter.

The proxy comes from the environment as an ordinary
``tg://proxy?server=...&port=...&secret=...`` link, so which secret flavour is
under test is a property of the environment rather than of the code; the
``_MTPROXY_LINK_PARAMETERS`` comment in ``conftest.py`` says why it is one
variable. The layers exercised are the same three the WEB proxy test drives,
for the same reasons; see ``test_web_proxy_live.py`` for what each of them
proves.

Skipped unless the environment carries a proxy to run against. Fill in
.env.test from .env.test.example, then::

    make test-integration
