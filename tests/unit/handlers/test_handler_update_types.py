"""Every handler names the type it is handed, and that type is an `Update`.

A callback handed something that is not an `Update` can neither be filtered on its sender
nor stop the chain, because both live on `Update`. Neither failure announces itself: the
sender filters answer `False`, which reads as "no sender" rather than "never looked".
