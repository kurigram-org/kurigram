"""What the sweeps share: which files they read, and how they read a name.

The name sweeps ask the same question of a different kind of text: does this name exist.
Neither can answer it statically, because the tree is one import cycle wide and half the
names it writes are only bound under `TYPE_CHECKING`, so both resolve against the imported
package.
