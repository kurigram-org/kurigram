"""Where a module declares `__all__`, the declaration covers everything the module defines.

`ruff` already holds one half of this: `F401` fails on a name imported and neither used nor
listed, and `F822` fails on a listed name that resolves to nothing. Neither looks at a class
or a function the module defines itself, so a barrel that grows a class beside its imports
drops it from the public API the moment `__all__` appears, and nothing says so.

That is not hypothetical: the commit that first gave `pyrogram/__init__.py` an `__all__` left
`StopTransmission`, `StopPropagation` and `ContinuePropagation` out of it, and all three are
documented, caught by name in `pyrogram/dispatcher.py`, and imported by the methods.
