"""Every module that writes an annotation defers it.

Without `from __future__ import annotations` a name used in an annotation has to exist at
import time, and the tree is one import cycle wide: the way round it was to quote the
annotation, which hides it from `ruff`'s `UP037` and from anything else that reads one. With
the import, the quotes are unnecessary everywhere and their absence is checkable.

The sweep reads the package, the suite and the compilers, which is every module a person here
maintains. One rule over all three is what makes it checkable at all: whether a given module
needs the import depends on what its own annotations name and in what order, so "where it is
needed" is not a question this or any other sweep can answer.
