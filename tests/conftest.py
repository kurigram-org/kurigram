# The marker comes from the directory a test file lives in, not from a decorator
#  on each test - a path cannot be forgotten the way a decorator can. These three are
#  the whole tree, and collection refuses anything outside them: `make test-unit` runs
#  `-m 'not integration'`, so a test that never reaches this mapping collects unmarked
#  and runs there whatever it opens. The environment `.env.test` carries is loaded by
#  the runner (see `Makefile`), not from here: a test process that reads files of its
#  own has two config sources.
