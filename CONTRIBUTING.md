# Contributing to Kurigram

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! This document covers how to set up a development
environment, the expected workflow, and what we look for in a pull request.

## Getting started

Kurigram requires Python `>=3.10` and [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

Nothing else has to be set up. Every `make` recipe below runs through `uv run`, which creates
`.venv` from `uv.lock` and brings it up to date whenever the lock file moves, so there is no
environment step to forget. To install without running anything:

```bash
make sync
```

Development tools live in the `dev` dependency group and are installed by default; the
documentation build has its own `docs` group, which the docs recipes select on their own. Neither
is an extra, so `pip install kurigram[dev]` is not a thing. After changing a dependency in
`pyproject.toml`, run `uv lock` and commit `uv.lock` with the change.

`make docs` builds the documentation once; `make docs-serve` serves it locally and refreshes the
page while you edit.

### Generated code

`pyrogram/raw/{types,functions,base,all.py}` and `pyrogram/errors/exceptions/` are generated from
TL schema files and are not tracked in git. Run the generator before working on anything that
touches type checking or code that imports from `pyrogram.raw`, and again after any change
under `compiler/api/source`:

```bash
make api
```

Never hand-edit files under these paths. If a change appears to require editing generated code,
the actual fix belongs in the compiler/templates under `compiler/`, or in the code that consumes
the generated types.

## Development workflow

Run these before opening a pull request:

```bash
make lint          # ruff check, plus ruff format --check
make typecheck     # ty check (requires `make api` to have been run first)
make test-unit     # the offline suite, no relay or session needed
```

`make test-unit` reports coverage of `pyrogram/` as it runs. Which paths are measured, whether a
minimum is enforced, and why, all live in the `[tool.coverage]` blocks of `pyproject.toml`.

`make format` rewrites the tree and `make lint` fails on anything it would still change, so
formatting is not something review has to raise. The line length is 100; `pyproject.toml` carries
the reasoning next to it.

That 100 is a target for the formatter, not a checked limit, so keep new code inside it by hand.
The formatter only asks whether a file matches its own output, and a literal already alone on its
line has no break point left, so an over-long string or f-string passes. `E501` is the rule that
would measure the column, and it is deliberately not selected: it reports around 2260 lines, and
all but a handful of them are docstrings copied from the Telegram API documentation.

`make test` runs the full suite, including the integration tests. Those open real sockets and
take every endpoint from a git-ignored `.env.test` file: a live MTProto or web proxy relay and a
prepared session, listed in `.env.test.example`. Each one skips by name when its variable is
absent, so a checkout without that file still runs the whole offline suite.

A test's directory decides its marker, so put it in the tree that matches what it needs:
`tests/integrations/` when it opens a socket or talks to a real service, `tests/guards/` when it
sweeps the whole repository instead of exercising one module, `tests/unit/` otherwise. A test
outside all three is not collected as unmarked, it fails the run:

```
ERROR: test_example.py is outside tests/guards, tests/integrations, tests/unit - every test lives in one of them.
```

`make test-guards` runs the guard layer on its own, for working on it; `make test-unit` already
includes it.

### Dependency ranges

Everything above installs from `uv.lock`, so it only ever exercises one point inside each
declared range. Two more recipes cover the ends of it, each in an environment of its own
(`.venv-floor`, `.venv-ceil`) built from `pyproject.toml` rather than the lock file:

```bash
make test-floor    # oldest allowed version of every dependency, on the oldest supported Python
make test-ceil     # newest released version of every dependency, on the newest supported Python
```

CI runs both on every push and again weekly, which is what catches a release published after the
last `uv lock`. Neither recipe writes `uv.lock`. Run `make test-floor` after raising a floor in
`pyproject.toml`, and note that the interpreter versions live at the top of the `Makefile` and
have to move with `requires-python` and the CI matrix.

### Optional: pre-commit hook

The repository ships a `pre-commit` config that runs `make lint` and `make typecheck` on commit,
the same two checks CI runs, so a breach never reaches review:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

### Linting and type checking policy

`ruff`'s selected rule set and `ty`'s rule overrides in `pyproject.toml` are both intentionally
narrower than "everything the tool can check": they're expanded incrementally, one rule at a
time, as the codebase is brought into compliance with it. When contributing:

- Don't widen an ignored `ty` rule or narrow the `ruff` rule set just to make a change pass.
- Fix the underlying issue instead.
- Don't make unrelated style changes to code outside the rules already enforced; keep pull
  requests focused on their stated purpose.

## Code style conventions

A few conventions that have come up repeatedly in code review but aren't enforced by `ruff` or
`ty`, so they're written down here instead:

- **Every new `.py` file carries the licence header** that the rest of the tree carries: copy it
  from a module in the same package. The only files without one are the empty package
  `__init__.py` files. Nothing checks this, so a missing header only surfaces in review.
- **Always use `list[str]` and `int | None`, never `List[str]` and `Optional[int]`.** The
  `typing` generics are deprecated aliases of the builtins.
  https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#deprecated-aliases
- **Every module carries `from __future__ import annotations as _annotations`**, directly below
  the docstring. The import is what lets an annotation name a type the module imports only under
  `TYPE_CHECKING`, so nothing in the tree quotes an annotation and `UP037` can stay selected;
  `tests/guards/test_future_annotations.py` fails on a package module that writes one without it.
  Keep the alias: the name is never used, and the underscore says the import is there for its
  side effect alone.
- **A dependency is declared with a floor, never a ceiling.** `pyproject.toml` carries the
  reasoning beside the declarations. Where a major version genuinely breaks us, add the upper
  bound and name the breakage in a comment next to it.
- **No `assert` for runtime guards in library code.** `assert` statements are stripped when
  Python runs with `-O`, and raise a bare `AssertionError` with no context for library consumers.
  Raise `RuntimeError` (or a more specific exception) instead.
- **When raising with a message, assign it to a variable first**, then raise it, rather than
  writing the message inline in the `raise` statement:

  ```python
  msg = f"connection not open (state={self._state})"
  raise RuntimeError(msg)
  ```

- **All code references in comments use backticks**, and every reference in the comment, not
  just the first one. Write ``Call `Client.stop()` before `Client.start()`.``, not
  `Call Client.stop() before Client.start().`
- **No em dashes or `--` as punctuation in comments.** Use a comma, colon, parentheses, or a
  single `-` instead. `tests/guards/test_comment_dashes.py` fails on one, so this is checked
  rather than caught in review; a `--` that is a flag (`--fix`) or the end-of-options marker
  (`grep -v -- -`) keeps its dashes. Docstrings are out of scope. The guard reads `#` comments in
  `.toml`, `.yml`, `.yaml`, the `Makefile` and `.gitignore` as well as `.py`, because a config
  comment went out with an em dash while the suite was green; the sweep asserts it reached one
  file of each format, so dropping one fails rather than passing quietly.
- **Every `# noqa: CODE` carries a reason** after a single `-`, as in
  ``# noqa: F403 - generated by `make api`, absent from a fresh checkout``. Same shape and
  same reason as the `# ty: ignore` rule below: `ruff` reads the codes and stops, so the text
  after them is ours to spend on why the suppression is there.
- **A re-export is spelled `# noqa: F401` with a reason, never `from .x import Name as Name`.**
  The redundant alias silences `F401` by looking like a typing convention, and a reader has to
  know that convention to see it is deliberate at all. Where the module has an `__all__`,
  listing the name there is better still: nothing is suppressed and the export is declared.
- **A module's `__all__` covers everything the module defines.** `ruff` holds one half of this:
  `F401` fails on a name imported and neither used nor listed, `F822` on a listed name that
  resolves to nothing. Neither looks at a class or function the module defines itself, so a
  barrel that grows one beside its imports drops it from the public API and nothing says so.
  `tests/guards/test_public_exports.py` fails on that, on a repeated entry, and on an `__all__`
  built by concatenation or comprehension, which reads as a declaration while leaving the other
  two checks nothing to read. Declaring one is not required: the aggregator `__init__.py` files
  under `pyrogram/methods/` collect mixins for `Client` rather than exporting an API.
- **Every `# ty: ignore[rule]` carries a reason** after a single `-`, as in
  `# ty: ignore[unresolved-import] - optional, not a project dependency`. Only the `[rule]`
  bracket is `ty`'s own syntax; the reason is ours, so nobody has to reconstruct why the
  ignore is there.
- **A parameter that needs to distinguish "not passed" from a meaningful `None`** (for example,
  a `reply_markup` parameter where `None` means "remove the markup") should default to the
  `object` class itself (not an instance of it) as the "not specified" sentinel, keeping `None`
  free to carry its own meaning. Check for existing uses of this pattern elsewhere in the method
  or type before introducing a new one.
- **Test doubles that stand in for `Client`** are named `FakeClient`, not `Client` or `TestClient`
  (pytest warns about `Test*` classes that define `__init__`). Most of the test suite already
  does this: reuse the name rather than inventing one per test file.
- **Module-level constants that never change** should be annotated `Final`.
- **An optional third-party import** (a package the project doesn't depend on, used defensively
  behind a feature that needs it) is marked `# ty: ignore[unresolved-import]`, with the reason
  saying it's optional and linking to the [docs](https://docs.kurigram.icu) section covering
  that feature, if there is one.
- **Never write `or None` on a `raw.*` field the schema declares `flags.N?true`.** That field has
  no payload: the flag bit is the value, and the generated writer sets the bit from a plain
  truthiness test, so `False` and `None` write the same bytes and the `or None` reads as a guard
  that guards nothing. `tests/guards/test_flag_only_fields.py` fails on one, naming the file and
  the field. The other optional types (`flags.N?Bool`, `?string`, `?Vector<T>`) carry their value
  separately from the bit, so `or None` there is a real choice and stays.

## Commit and pull request guidelines

- Write commit messages using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/),
  matching the existing git history: `fix(session): ...`, `feat(deps): ...`, `docs(api): ...`.
  Name a scope; almost every commit on `dev` carries one, and the few that don't are the ones
  nobody can place afterwards.
- **The pull request title matters, not just commit messages.** The project squash-merges, so
  the PR title becomes the actual commit message on `dev`. Title it the same way you would a
  commit: `type(scope): description`, describing what the change actually does rather than a
  generic label. If the branch gains more commits or changes scope before merge, update the title
  to match; don't leave it describing an earlier, narrower version of the change.
- Keep pull requests focused on one logical change. Unrelated fixes should be separate PRs.
- Reference any related issue in the pull request description.
